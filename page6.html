        <p>
            <em>Rated World's 5th best travel destination</em>
 
        <p>
           The Bohemian allure and fairytale features of Prague, #5 in the World in this year's Travelers' Choice Destination Awards, make it a perfect destination for beach-weary vacationers who want to immerse themselves in culture. Spend a full day exploring Prazsky hrad (Prague Castle), then refuel over a hearty dinner at a classic Czech tavern. Spend some time wandering the Old Town Square before heading over to gape at The Old Town Hall and Astronomical Clock. Pragueâ€™s best bars are found in cellars, where historic pubs set the scene for a night of traditional tippling.

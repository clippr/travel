        <h1>Cape Town, South Africa</h1>
        
        
    
        
        <p>
            <em>Rated World's 10th best travel destination</em>
 
        <p>
           Cape Town, #10 on the list of Travelers' Choice Destination World Winners, glistens at the southern tip of the African continent. Picture-perfect views at Blaauwberg Beach and Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens are within easy driving distance of "The Mother City." The Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve provides sweeping sea vistas, hiking trails and wildlife encounters. On a more somber note, travelers can visit Robben Island, the prison where Nelson Mandela was held for 27 years.

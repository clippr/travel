            <em>Rated World's 4th best travel destination</em>

           Hanoi is #4 in the world in this year's Travelers' Choice Destinations Awards. The charming Vietnamese capital has aged well, preserving the Old Quarter, monuments and colonial architecture, while making room for modern developments alongside. Once called Thang Long, or "ascending dragon," this centuries-old city hasn't forgotten its past, as attested by sites such as Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison. Lakes, parks, shady boulevards, and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi.

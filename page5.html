        <p>
            <em>Rated World's 6th best travel destination</em>
 
        <p>
           The crown jewels, Buckingham Palace, Camden Market…in London, a perennial Travelers' Choice Award winner, history collides with art, fashion, food, and good British ale. A perfect day is different for everyone: culture aficionados shouldn't miss the Tate Modern and the Royal Opera House. If you love fashion, Oxford Street has shopping galore. For foodies, cream tea at Harrod’s or crispy fish from a proper chippy offers classic London flavor. Music and book buffs will love seeing Abbey Road and the Sherlock Holmes Museum (at 221B Baker Street, of course).
